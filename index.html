        <div class = "About_Body" > <img src = "assets\Images\Me and dog.jpg" alt = "Me" class = "image2"> My name is Paul Allen and im 22. However most people call me Baboon or Babs. A little About me is that I have always been intrested in computers and coding as far as I can remember. 
          I started to code in middle school doing small work with Java in Minecraft for Minecraft servers, then went on to go to college at Belmont University for computer programming for 2 years. 
          how ever I started to think coding was not for me and went to Nashville Community College for achitecture for a year were I decided to drop from that conculding college in person was not for me.
          Now I am attending Vanderbilt Bootcamp online.
